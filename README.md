## Installation

#### Other Languages Available

   - [日本語：Onlinegaming.life](https://onlinegaming.life/ff14/ember-overlay/)

To use this overlay, you need Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) and OverlayPlugin. Please follow the guide based on your situation:

### You don't have ACT or OverlayPlugin

Please follow [the ACT + OverlayPlugin installation guide](https://github.com/GoldenChrysus/ffxiv-ember-overlay/blob/bleeding-edge/ACT_INSTALLATION.md) from the beginning.

### You already have ACT but need OverlayPlugin

Please follow [the OverlayPlugin installation guide](https://github.com/GoldenChrysus/ffxiv-ember-overlay/blob/bleeding-edge/ACT_INSTALLATION.md#installing-overlayplugin).

### You already have ACT and OverlayPlugin

Choose the guide based on your version of OverlayPlugin:

#### ngld OverlayPlugin

1. Within ACT, navigate to Plugins > OverlayPlugin.dll.
2. Set your overlay URL to https://goldenchrysus.github.io/ffxiv/ember-overlay/ or add a new overlay with the Ember preset selected (presets available in ngld OverlayPlugin 0.13.0 or later).

#### hibiyasleep or RainbowMage OverlayPlugin

1. Within ACT, navigate to Plugins > OverlayPlugin.dll > Mini Parse.
2. Set the URL to https://goldenchrysus.github.io/ffxiv/ember-overlay/
3. Click "Reload overlay," and the overlay should now be visible in your FFXIV game.

### Older Guides (ACTWebSocket and 0.3.4.0 OverlayPlugin)

If you need to see the old ACTWebSocket or 0.3.4.0 OverlayPlugin guides, they can be accessed [here](https://github.com/GoldenChrysus/ffxiv-ember-overlay/tree/0.15.0-alpha#installation).

## Changelog

View the full changelog [here](/CHANGELOG.md).

## Staging Site

You can access and test features in advance by using the staging site. Instead of the regular URL, set your overlay to https://goldenchrysus.github.io/ffxiv/ember-overlay-dev/

Please note that the staging site is for pre-release testing, so you may encounter errors. Please report these errors as GitHub issues or in the #bug-reports channel on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/7Kdpw6C).

When viewing the [changelog](/CHANGELOG.md), you will be able to determine which changes are available on the staging site because they will be prefixed with "!" in the changelog for the latest development version.

## Contributing

### Process

0. For new features, it would be best to first discuss your plans in an issue. This is to ensure that I haven't already completed a similar feature locally, that I agree with your approach, and that your feature aligns with the overall vision of the project. Bypassing this and sending new features straight to pull may result in pull rejection.
1. Create a fork.
2. Make your changes and follow the coding guidelines.
3. Commit with meaningful messages that describe your changes.
4. Create a pull request.
5. Ensure your pull request describes the nature and purpose of your changes.

### Coding Guidelines
This list is not exhaustive and generally applies to formatting. Your merge request may be rejected for other reasons including but not limited to: formatting issues not specified here, architectural concerns, or functionality concerns.

- Indentation must use tabs.
- Variable assignment equal signs should be aligned using spaces.
- Use `let` for all variable declarations unless unreasonable (e.g. `var` for scoping reasons or `const` for constants).
- Variable comparisons should use `===`.
- Variable names should be descriptive and not misspelled.
- Variable names should be snake_case.
- Function names should be camelCase.
- Class names should be PascalCase.
- String quotation should be done with double-quotes, not single-quotes, except in cases of interpolation where backticks would be used.
- Trailing whitespace should be stripped.
- Do not refactor surrounding code unless necessary for your change.
- `return` statements should be as early or late in a function as possible; avoid `return` statements in the middle of a function.
- Opening curly braces (`{`) for classes, functions, and control blocks should be on the same line as the block, e.g. `if (some_var === true) {`.
- Use arrow functions unless needing to inherit the class or function context.
- Ensure the final version of your code is free of debug code.
